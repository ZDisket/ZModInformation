# ZModInformation
Custom mod information addon for SuperPower 2

This defines the format for a simple mod manager which will make installing SuperPower 2 mods easy, with mod authors 
being able to pack their mods into compatible packages which the manager will handle installing them for the user.

This repo contains all the dependencies and should compile and run out the box. You'll have to provide your own sample mod folder if you want
to run the test program
